Suam LULC Analysis 2025: Comparative Machine Learning Performance1. Project OverviewThis repository contains the data and software used for a comparative Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) analysis in the Suam region (Mt. Elgon, Kenya/Uganda). The study utilizes a high-dimensional feature stack (82 bands) derived from Landsat 9 and compares five machine learning classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Minimum Distance (MD), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).2. Repository Structure/scripts:analysis_gee.js: The primary Google Earth Engine JavaScript code for feature extraction, automated training point generation, and model training.visualizations.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code to reproduce the accuracy assessment figures (Figures 3, 4, and 5)./data:training_points.csv: The final set of 2,063 stratified training samples used for model calibration and validation.3. How to Reproduce the ResultsStep 1: Satellite Image Processing (GEE)Copy the contents of scripts/analysis_gee.js.Paste it into the Google Earth Engine Code Editor.Run the script to view the classified maps and export the topographic statistics.A static snapshot of the script is also available here: [https://code.earthengine.google.com/9cd46be3da82dc9030a23ac2e354f5ab]Step 2: Accuracy Visualizations (Python)The results of the accuracy assessment are visualized using Python. You can run the visualizations.ipynb notebook to generate:Figure 3: Comparative Normalized Confusion Matrices.Figure 4: Disagreement Analysis (Quantity vs. Allocation error).Figure 5: McNemar’s Test (Statistical Significance).4. Key ResultsClassification AccuracyThe study found that Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GBM) significantly outperformed traditional methods (MD) and single-tree methods (CART).Disagreement BreakdownBy analyzing Quantity Disagreement (QD) and Allocation Disagreement (AD), we identified that most errors in the top-tier models were related to spatial allocation rather than class abundance.Statistical SignificanceMcNemar's test confirms that the performance gains of RF over the baseline models are statistically significant ($p < 0.001$).5.
